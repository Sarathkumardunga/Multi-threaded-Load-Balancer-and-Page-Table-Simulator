# Multi-threaded-Load-Balancer-and-Page-Table-Simulator
This repository contains the implementation of two advanced system simulations: a multi-threaded load balancer and a page table simulator using FIFO, LRU, and MFU page replacement algorithms. The projects demonstrate concepts such as multi-threading, mutexes, file operations, and efficient memory management through page fault handling.
